My friend wants a new band name for her band. 
She likes bands that use the formula: 'The' + a noun with first letter capitalized. 
However, when a noun STARTS and ENDS with the same letter, she likes to repeat the noun
twice and connect them together with the first and last letter, 
combined into one word like so (WITHOUT a 'The' in front):
dolphin -> The Dolphin alaska -> Alaskalaska europe -> Europeurope

def band_name(name)
    if name[0] == name[-1]
       return (name + name[1..-1]).capitalize
    else
       return "The #{name.capitalize}"
    end
end
